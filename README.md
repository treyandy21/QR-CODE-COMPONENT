## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I learned to use flexbox as a responsive media that is when you reduce the screen size the webpage is responsive to size been shriken into and ajusts itself accordingly.
I learned to centralize the image by using text-align center i.e ``css  .container {text align :center }            ``in that same line using css selector to effect changes of css style is using class ``html   <div main ="container"> </div>   `` ``css  .html{background-color:white}``
I remembered to use border-radius to make edge bit circular ie.``border-radius:50px``
I learned to use padding it is the distance between border and the margin and margin is the distance between padding and the other element .
Still unable to host the project on github pages and vercel pages.Still figuring out on how to reduce the size of the image so that i could get the screenshot of it .


### Continued development

I would like to learn more on css grid as a responsive layout and css flexbox in a more indepth
